Demonstrates a special technique for infinitely looping the scroll as well as a set of items. Includes smooth snapping

This version fluidly scrolls between the items and then snaps, but if you want to see an earlier version that always snaps (while scrolling), see https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/LYRwgPo?editors=0010
