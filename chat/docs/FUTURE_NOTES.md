# Remrin - Future Notes & Improvements

## Auth & Onboarding Issues

### Login/Registration
- [ ] Add toast notifications for success/error
- [ ] Add "check your email" message after registration
- [ ] Add Google OAuth login
- [ ] Hide randomly generated username during onboarding
- [ ] Custom display name selection (streamlined)

### API Settings
- [ ] Hide "Add API Key" option after registration
- [ ] Bury API selection in Settings for Premium users only
- [ ] We sell API credits - users shouldn't bring their own (for now)
- [ ] Future: Maybe allow own API for Premium tier

## Age Gating & Safety

### Family-Friendly Strategy
- [ ] Separate Teen/Adult settings from children's experience
- [ ] Age verification during registration
- [ ] Content filtering based on age bracket
- [ ] NOT offering NSFW content - keeping Remrin family friendly
- [ ] Block children from Teen/Adult restricted areas

### Reference: Talkie's Onboarding

**What to use from Talkie:**
- Age selection (0-13, 14-17, 18-20, etc.)
- Clean visual design

**What to skip:**
- Pronouns (keeping family-friendly, simpler)
- Relationship preference

## Personas Tab Fixes

- [ ] "Link Soul" popup is broken
- [ ] Auto-email with Soul_id if creation fails
- [ ] Manual linking fallback for edge cases

## Priority Order

1. **HIGH**: Auth overhaul (Session 8)
2. **HIGH**: Fix broken Personas tab linking
3. **MEDIUM**: Age gating implementation
4. **MEDIUM**: Hide API settings for non-premium
5. **LOW**: Onboarding flow polish
