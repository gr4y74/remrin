    "GEMINI_API_VERSIONING": {
      "Issue": "Confusion over model names causing '404 Not Found' or '429 Rate Limit'.",
      "Learnings": [
        "❌ 'gemini-1.5-flash' (Generic alias) -> Often returns 404 Not Found on v1beta.",
        "❌ 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' -> Deprecated/Not Found.",
        "⚠️ 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp' -> Works but hits strict Rate Limits (3.6s timeout) on Free Tier.",
